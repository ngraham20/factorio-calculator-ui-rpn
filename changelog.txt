      providing the fix for it <3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.5
Date: 2020-06-08
  Info:
    - Features some fancy sound effects and a special [Nilaus](https://www.youtube.com/c/Nilaus) 
      mode.
  Features:
    - Features sound effects to the calculator whenever a result may be not the desired one (has be
      enabled in the settings)
  Changes:
    - Emotes will no longer be displayed at default, "Nilaus mode" has to be enabled for the emotes
      to appear again
  Bugfixes:
    - Recent results weren't properly cleared in 0.18.4

    - Some code rework, not too fancy stuff

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.4
Date: 2020-06-07
  Info:
    - Based on user feedback updated the mod
  Features:
    - Features the possibility to copy the results (from recent and also the current) to the
      display
  Changes:
    - Window now remember last location when opened
    - Updated the BS button (it's backspace people...) so it now has a nice icon instead of the
      letters
    - Recent results now add to the top, instead of the bottom
    - When calculator is opened it focues on the display for entering the equation
    - You can click pretty much anywhere now and it focues on the display for entering the equation
  Bugfixes:
    - On multiplayer session the window would lag behind while dragging, because the location would
      be saved on server. This isn't going to happen anymore, hopefully (not tested yet).
    - When window is moved out of boundaries, when reopened, it will correct itself to be fully in
      sight again.
    - Settings had weird default values (were set 2 times)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.3
Date: 2020-06-07
  Info:
    - A small visual overhaul of the mod
  Features:
    - Features the possibility to "calculate further" (especially usefull when setting "Clear
      equation on calculation" is set). When the equation doesn't start with a number, character or
      parenthesis (so it assumes it starts with a math symbol) it will take the previous result and
      prepend it to the current equation.
  Changes:
    - Updated the UI a bit to match it in color a bit more to the Windows calculator
    - Updated also the icon on the shortcut to better distinguish it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.2
Date: 2020-06-06
  Info:
    - Based on user feedback updated the mod
  Features:
    - new easter egg :-)
    - Features more math.lib functions
      - atan2() -> math.atan2()
      - cosh() -> math.cosh()
      - sinh() -> math.sinh()
      - tanh() -> math.tanh()
      - log10() -> math.log10()
      - fmod() -> math.fmod()
      - frexp() -> math.frexp()
      - ldexp() -> math.ldexp()
      - pow() -> math.pow()
  Bugfixes:
    - Interpreting ";" as "," in the equation, because of the fix in 0.18.1, so that math functions
      with more than 1 parameter work. They have to use ";" as a separator for inputs
    - Bugfixes sqrt(-1) equaling "na" because of the rounding fix from 0.18.1. It does now show
      "NaN" again

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.1
Date: 2020-06-06
  Info:
    - Based on user feedback updated the mod
  Features:
    - Shortcut for opening the calculator and automatically focus on the input (Default:
      Ctrl+Shift+C) 
  Bugfixes:
    - Rounding removed 0 at the end, will now stand as it should. So 2.0000001 -> 2.00
    - Interpreting "," as "." in the equation, because of some European countries do have a weird
      keyboard layout

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.0
Date: 2020-06-06
  Info:
    - Initial Release of the mod 
    - Compatible with Factorio >0.18.0; tested on 0.18.30
    - Based on the 4-Function Calculator found in the 
      [Max Rate Calculator](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/MaxRateCalculator) mod by
      [Theanderblast](https://mods.factorio.com/user/theanderblast)
  Features:
    - History of recent calculations
    - Possibility to copy recent calculations to the current one (with shift+left-click)
    - Substitutes some functions & "constants" of the Lua
      [math-lib](http://lua-users.org/wiki/MathLibraryTutorial)
      - abs() -> math.abs()
      - acos() -> math.acos()
      - asin() -> math.asin()
      - atan() -> math.atan()
      - ceil() -> math.ceil()
      - floor() -> math.floor()
      - cos() -> math.cos()
      - sin() -> math.sin()
      - tan() -> math.tan()
      - deg() -> math.deg()
      - rad() -> math.rad()
      - exp() -> math.exp()
      - log() -> math.log()
      - min() -> math.min()
      - max() -> math.max()
      - modf() -> math.modf()
      - sqrt() -> math.sqrt()
      - huge -> math.huge
      - pi -> math.pi
    - Allows the use of "%" (percent sign) in the calculation
    - A little easter egg :-)
    - Setting for number of decimal places in result (Default: 2). Exact value will be displayed in
      the tooltip
    - Setting if triggering the calculation should clear the current equation (Default: no)
  Changes:
    - Made the buttons slightly bigger, so that it's better readable on streams.
    - Allows to make "complex" calculations with parentheses
    - Allows pretty much all characters in the equation field
      - but the "=" (equal sign) will trigger the calculation
  Ease of use:
    - Got rid of the memory functions - but introduced the list of recent calculations instead
